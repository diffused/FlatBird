I wanted a "flat design" theme for my Xubuntu box. 

This is a rough hack of default Greybird theme that comes with Xubuntu 12.10

Removed many of the gradient effects, squared up the window edges, made window edges the same color as bg and other stylesheet tweaks.

Make sure you turn on Compositor and enable window shadows otherwise it's hard to disguish the edges.
